# AttendanceCredits
Mark attendance and give special credits to users by giving one-use QRs (generated by the admin in-app).

## Use Case Example
 - Host a web service which has two kinds of users: *1) Attendees* and *2) Admin*.
 - The admin can generate new signed one-use QR codes.
 - The attendees make their profile and once logged in, they scan the QR code and receive attendance on their profile.
 - This is not limited to attendance. New categories like answering questions, winning the hackathon, trophies, etc. can also be introduced.
 - These credits can then be used later to prove attendance and earn some rights - registration/nfts/prizes/others.

## Making this exportable
 - A future aim would be to make this zero knowledge proof friendly.
 - A starting point is using [Reclaim HTTPS Provider](https://docs.reclaimprotocol.org/using-the-https-provider), to be a part of future commits.

## Folders
 - *backend* folder contains the backend logic - handles routes, authentication, storage, etc.
 - *frontend* folder is the react app folder - fetches data from backend and renders it.

## Usage
```sh
cd backend
npm i
npm run start
cd ../frontend
npm i
npm run start
```
